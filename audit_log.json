Recommendations\n\n### Priority Actions for Today\n1. **Immediate:** Source alternative materials for production line A to address critical shortage\n2. **High Priority:** Deploy maintenance team to repair assembly station 3\n3. **High Priority:** Conduct root cause analysis on component X quality issues\n4. **Today:** Review schedule for orders #1005-1007 and develop recovery plan\n\n### Resource Allocation Suggestions\n1. Temporarily reassign personnel from closed orders to support behind-schedule work\n2. Request additional quality inspectors for component X investigation\n3. Prepare contingency staffing plan if equipment repairs",
